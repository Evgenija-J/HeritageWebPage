# HeritageWebPage

We have created a separate folder for this homework because we had no correct implementation for homework3 (can be found on this link https://github.com/esraimeri/Software-Design-and-Architecture/tree/main/src). Our current project is following the MVC pattern and has implemented microservices in map.js file. 

We have also uploaded a video of all the functionalities because we did not manage to host the web application.
